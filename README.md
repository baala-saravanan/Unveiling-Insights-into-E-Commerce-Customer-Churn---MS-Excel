🚀 Unveiling Insights into E-Commerce Customer Churn 🚀 In today’s competitive e-commerce landscape, understanding customer churn is critical to building long-term relationships and sustaining business growth. I recently completed an in-depth analysis of customer churn dynamics using historical transactional data, focusing on key customer attributes like: Tenure Preferred payment modes Satisfaction scores Purchase behavior This analysis provided valuable insights into how different factors such as distance from customers, complaints received, and preferred order categories influence churn behavior. Some key findings include: High churn rates among customers with shorter tenures and specific purchasing preferences (e.g., fashion). Satisfaction scores significantly impacted by complaints and preferred order categories. A strong correlation between payment modes (e.g., UPI, e-wallets) and churn tendencies. By visualizing trends and analyzing patterns, I was able to identify critical drivers of customer attrition, ultimately offering actionable insights for targeted retention strategies. This work reinforces the importance of leveraging data to inform business decisions and reduce churn, ensuring profitability and customer satisfaction. #DataAnalytics #CustomerChurn #ECommerce #RetentionStrategy #DataScience #BusinessGrowth
